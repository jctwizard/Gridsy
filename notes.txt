TODO
- hotel with each room a different game
- narrative connecting different rooms

STRETCH

BUGS
- input sometimes continues after releasing key (only seems to happen if switch tab/minimise while holding a key)
- desyncing on exits and dialogue (?)


TESTS
basic.html: Using Bitsy v4.9 (last version before onkeydown function was changed to store movement variables - causing desync of movement)
https://github.com/le-doux/bitsy/commit/25949c0433fa55ac72c563b9941ca74e1a93cffa

loopTest.html: If we use exits all around the edge to make a looping room, the avatar 'hops' over the edge so it doesn't appear seamless. 
Some solutions would be:
1. use a tile for the edge that makes sense narratively
2. do not render the edge in the webpage
3. do not make a gridsy that relies on seamless edge-looping
